# Solidity Smart Contracts

Welcome to the smart contracts repository

Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

For a good overview and starting point, please check out the official Solidity Language Portal

Testnet Used: Rinkeby

Main Faucet: https://faucets.chain.link

Here you will find all the smart contracts I have written that includes some basic solidity concepts and tokens creation

**Tools and Tech Used:**
Solidity, 
EVM,
Remix IDE,
Truffle, 
ERC20, 
ERC721 on Opensea,
OpenZeppelin,
Alchemy,
ChainLink Oracles

1) Solidity Basic Smart Contract 
2) Fixed Length and Dynamic Arrays 
3) Books Libray smart contract uses Structures, Mapping, Modifier, Constructor and require method
4) ERC20 Token creation on Remix IDE deployed on Goreli Test Network
5) Bank Account Transactions Smart Contract
6) ERC721 Token using Alchemy
